## Big Numbers

### Overview

The **Big Numbers** project implements a `CBigInt` class in C++ to handle arbitrarily large integers. This class supports standard arithmetic operations, comparisons, and input/output, making it suitable for applications that require high-precision calculations beyond the capacity of built-in data types.

### Features

- **Arbitrary Precision**: Supports integers of virtually unlimited size.
- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Addition, multiplication, and their compound assignment counterparts.
- **Comparison Operators**: Full set of comparison operators.
- **Stream Input/Output**: Easy integration with standard input and output streams.

## Computer Network System

### Overview

The **Computer Network System** project simulates networks, computers, and their components in C++. It models various hardware components and allows users to create, modify, and display these components within a simulated environment.

### Features

- **Component-Based Simulation**: Model CPUs, memory, disks, and more.
- **Network and Computer Models**: Organize components into computers and networks.
- **Visualization**: Display detailed configurations and structures.

## Data Types Simulation

### Overview

The **Data Types Simulation** project provides a set of C++ classes to simulate common data types (`int`, `double`, `enum`, and `struct`). These classes mimic how a compiler might handle these types internally, offering functionalities like size retrieval and equality checking.

### Features

- **Abstract Data Type Representation**: Simulate how compilers handle data types.
- **Type Operations**: Supports operations such as size retrieval and type comparison.
- **Flexible and Extensible**: Easily add new data types or modify existing ones.

## KMP Search System

### Overview

The **KMP Search System** project focuses on implementing the Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm for efficient substring search. This system is designed to find patterns within a text using the KMP string-matching algorithm.

### Features

- **Efficient Substring Search**: Uses the KMP algorithm for optimal pattern matching.
- **Generic Implementation**: Works with different types of sequences.
- **Utility Methods**: Includes additional methods for sequence management and manipulation.

## Student Database Simulator

### Overview

The **Student Database Simulator** project implements a student management system for a university's study department. It allows for the addition, deletion, and searching of student records, with capabilities for filtering and sorting based on various criteria.

### Features

- **Add and Delete Students**: Manage student records easily.
- **Filter and Search**: Flexible filtering based on multiple criteria.
- **Sorting**: Sort results based on various attributes.

## Subsequence Detection

### Overview

The **Subsequence Detection** project involves detecting repeated subsequences within a sequence. This is useful for applications such as data compression or plagiarism detection.

### Features

- **Subsequence Length Detection**: Find the longest subsequence that appears multiple times.
- **Position Combination Finding**: Locate all positions where a subsequence appears.

## Supermarket Management Simulation

### Overview

The **Supermarket Management Simulation** project provides a C++ class to manage inventory in a supermarket setting. It includes functionalities to store products with expiration dates, process shopping lists, and find expired products.

### Features

- **Store Products**: Add products with expiration dates and quantities.
- **Sell Products**: Process shopping lists and adjust inventory.
- **Find Expired Products**: Identify products that have expired.
